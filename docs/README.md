> "Complexity is the worst enemy of security, and our systems are getting more complex all the time."

&mdash;&mdash; Bruce Schneier, [Data and Goliath](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/41629774-data-and-goliath-the-hidden-battles-to-collect-your-data-and-control-yo)

Welcome to `cl0udn41v3`, the place on the Internet focusing on cloud native security
topics including but not limited to Kubernetes and serverless offerings such as AWS Lambda.

I plan to do an episode roughly every two weeks, travel allowing, and each episode has two parts:

- Updates on cloud native breaches, [CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org/), attacks, incidents, for example: [the Tesla hack](https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla).
- A hands-on part, aka the hack of the day, where I will demo something.

For now, there are two things you can do: 1. spread the word, and 2. if you have anything to share that's in scope, 
please <a href="mailto:tips@cloudnaive.online">drop me a line</a>.

And here's the Twitch stream for you to bookmark:

## Motivation

I've been reading Bruce Schneier's ["Click Here to Kill Everybody"](https://www.schneier.com/books/click_here/) and this motivated 
me to start thinking more about how we're doing concerning security in cloud native land. Already when Liz and I were working on the *Kubernetes Security* 
book I got more and more interested in attack vectors and good practices around container security, but Schneier's book really caused me to
get my act together and do something about it, proactively. So, yeah, might be that the one or other script kiddy is motivated by this site and 
this is a risk I gotta take. But my hope is that you, the cloud native practitioner, tune in here from time to time to stay up-to-date on
security topics across the cloud native landscape (from containers to Kubernetes to Function-as-a-Service offerings). I believe that *together* we 
can tackle the threats the Internet+ (well, read the Schneier book ;) poses!
