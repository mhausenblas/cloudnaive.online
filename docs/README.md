Welcome to `cl0udn41v3`, the place on the Internet that's focusing on cloud native security
topics including but not limited to Kubernetes and serverless offerings.

I plan to do an episode roughly every two weeks, travel allowing and each episode has two parts:

- updates on cloud native breaches, CVEs, attacks, incidents, for example: [the Tesla hack](https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla)
- a hands-on part, aka hack of the day, where I will demo something

For now, there are two things you can do: 1. spread the word, and 
2. if you have anything to share that falls into the scope, drop me
a mail at <a href="mailto:tips@cloudnaive.online">tips@cloudnaive.online</a>.

And here's the Twitch stream for you to bookmark:
