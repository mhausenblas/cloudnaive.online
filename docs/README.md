Welcome to `cl0udn41v3`, the place on the Internet focusing on cloud native security
topics including but not limited to Kubernetes and serverless offerings such as AWS Lambda.

I plan to do an episode roughly every two weeks, travel allowing, and each episode has two parts:

- Updates on cloud native breaches, [CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org/), attacks, incidents, for example: [the Tesla hack](https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla).
- A hands-on part, aka the hack of the day, where I will demo something.

For now, there are two things you can do: 1. spread the word, and 2. if you have anything to share that's in scope, please <a href="mailto:tips@cloudnaive.online">drop me
a line</a>.

And here's the Twitch stream for you to bookmark:
